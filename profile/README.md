# Teradata Labs

We build things to learn, not just to ship. This is where Teradata explores what's next.

## What's Here

Forward-looking work, reference implementations, and proof-of-concept projects. These repositories represent innovation explorations, not production Teradata software.

## Before You Dive In

Expect rough edges and evolving ideas. This is research code, not product. We can't offer official support, but we're here to learn with you. Questions and contributions welcome.
